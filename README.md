# CustomNewTab
Could be used as an extension for new tabs.

This is done by downloading these files and unloading the pack in extensions settings. Make sure its the CustomNewTab directory.

Started with the background and then worked on the clock.
After completing clock, the quote was next and the timer was last.
I had a lot of difficulty with the clock at the beginning but got easier over time.
The Pomodoro timer was somewhat difficult since there were many ways to make it.
It does have one problem which if you press start then it will decrease by a second.
